   Pass-Stash is meant to be a lightweight and locally hosted password manager and vault that is easy to use and provides its users with secure passwords with the push of a button. Additionally, users can create and manage entries for each account, allowing for a username, a password, and a nickname to be stored. All of these passwords are stored securely on the user's device, with the vault accessible through a user created Master Password (Coming Soon).

## Why Use Pass-Stash?
  Pass-Stash is different from most other password managers in that all of the data is stored locally as opposed to on a global server. This prevents your sensitive information from being compromised in the event of a major data breach. No matter if you have 3 passwords or 30, you can rest assured knowing that your data is safely stored on your device. Pass-Stash also allows you to generate strong passwords with the push of a button, ensuring that your accounts remain secure. 

## Installation
To install Pass-Stash you can download the executable file for your respective operating system. Additionally, you can run Pass-Stash using the source code from the PassStash.py document. You will know it is up and running once you are greeted with the start screen, shown here.

## Functions

  ### Password Generation
  Using a random character generator, Pass-Stash will create a secure 12 character password which you can use for any accounts that you want to keep safe. You can then copy the password and store it in the database.<br/>

</p>

  ### Account Creation
  To create an account entry in Pass-Stash, all you need is the username and password for the account, as well as a nickname for the entry that you can easily identify it with. Simply enter the data into each box and Pass-Stash will store each account so that you can easily recall your passwords.<br/>

</p>

  ### Account Search
  You can search for a specific account by entering the nickname you've given each entry, and Pass-Stash will pull up each entry under that nickname along with the username and password.<br/>

</p>

  ### Updating An Account
  Editing an entry can be done by entering the nickname and the username of the account you wish to change. Once you verify that the selected account is the one you are editing, you can enter the new credentials and Pass-Stash will update the entry. <br/>

</p>

  ### Deleting an Account
  Deleting an account is much like the editing process in that you enter the nickname and username of the account you want to delete. Once you confirm that the entry is the right one, you can either delete the entry or cancel the deletion if you change your mind. <br/>
